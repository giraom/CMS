# CMS
The CMS utility allows you to monitor databases in many ways, including inventory, backups, extended events, performance metrics and how late replication jobs are.
It also comes with utilities to help manage the environment and update replication as the schema changes. It supports SQL Servers Versions 2012 and later, Managed Instances and Azure SQL.
